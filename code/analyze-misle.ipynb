       "3151    On 13APR2018 at approximately 1500 hrs. the M/V CHARLEY WALLACE( CGB, 1000HP,ON 623276) was doing fleet work at the IL # 13 Fleet RDB MM 980 OHR when they were leaving the fleet downbound maneuvering back into the channel when the Port MDE had a reduction in propulsion and would not go over 700 RPM (Clutch speed). This caused the vessel to become pinned on its Starboard side against the fleet, and the vessel began taking on water and listing to Port. At that time the master came full ahead on the STRB MDE and was able to clear the fleet. The port list of the vessel caused by the intake of water continued, allowing a downflooding condition.  The vessel subsequently sunk approximately 100 ft from the IL # 13 Fleet RDB. All crew was able to exit the vessel in the water and was rescued by an assist vessel. Crewman did not experience any injuries from the incident, however a discharge of oil that created a sheen upon the navigable waters of the United States was observed as the vessel was sinking.  Location of the sunk vessel was marked and salvage plans were initiated.  As of 17JUL18, the vessel was not yet salvaged due to water conditions.  Unknown date as to when the salvage will be complete. Current plans are to refurbish vessel once recovered.\\n\\nCoast Guard investigation revealed the initiating event to be the sinking of the vessel. Contributing factors include 1)Unintended reduction in propulsion at a critical time of vessel operation. 2)High currents and river stage.\n",

The pilot on watch steered to stbd to try and catch the head but a face wire and wing wire broke on the STBD side. Crew attempted to catch more wires on tow but was unsuccessful and tow continued to drift to port as pilot was unsuccessful in stopping the head from swinging to port. Tow made contact with the long wall of Olmsted Lock causing 6 barges to break free of the tow. 4 barges were corraled without incident while 1 barge was pinned up against a construction barge at the Olmstead L&D and 1 barge pressed sideways straddling the #4 and #5 tainter gates at Olmstead L&D and sank.    \\n\\nCoast Guard investigation revealed the initiating event to be the material failure of the tow wires.

The void taking water in was found and attempts were made to put dewatering pumps into the space but were unsuccessful. At 2350 barge ING905 was approximately 88 percent loaded with approximately 3221 tons of coal when it buckled at the center line and began to sink.
